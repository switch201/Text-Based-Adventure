# Text-Based-Adventure

This is going to be the most basic readme you ever did see.
I run this game in miscrosoft visual studio (not VS code) and use a specific Nuget package to make funky ASCII font.
So the game will not run without that. 
Figgle Font is really the only dependency

* When the game starts you will be prompted to enter a name, and then select a class. the game will then roll for your attributes and you are on your way
* the game currently is just 3 rooms strung together in the following grid pattern [][] you start in the top right room
                                                                                   []
* you can type help for some help and that should get you on your way. in general though you can walk around open chests inspect things take items equip items
* you can eat a pumpkin pie and you can engage in some combat.
* There are some known issues I don't want to deal with at the moment. currently main goal is to make the game fun then I will go back and iron out any edge case bugs and so on.
* Currently game isn't that fun which is the problem so continued efforts on the game will be in an attempt to make it a game I want to play.
